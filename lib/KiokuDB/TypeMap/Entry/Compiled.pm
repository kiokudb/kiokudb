=head1 SYNOPSIS

TODO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class should be returned by L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry/compile>.
You probably shouldn't be using this directly; you may just want to consume
L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Std> or something.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item expand_method

Contains a subroutine reference (or a string, denoting a method name).  It is
called as method on the L<KiokuDB::Linker>.  Takes a L<KiokuDB::Entry> as an
argument, and should return the expanded object.

=item collapse_method

Contains a subroutine reference (or a string, denoting a method name).  It is
called as method on the L<KiokuDB::Collapser>.  Takes the object to
be collapsed as an argument, and should return a L<KiokuDB::Reference>.

=item id_method

Contains a subroutine reference (or a string, denoting a method name).  It is
called as method on the L<KiokuDB::Collapser>.  Takes the object to be
collapsed as an argument, and should return an ID for it .

=item refresh_method

Contains a subroutine reference (or a string, denoting a method name).  It is
called as method on the L<KiokuDB::Linker>.  Takes the object to be refreshed
and its corresponding L<KiokuDB::Entry> as arguments.

=item class

The class for which the methods are being compiled.

=item entry

The L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry> that created this object.
